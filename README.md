- **Argo & Reserve Platforms:** Developing integrations and data-sync automations between corporate travel and expense systems.
- **Custom GUI Tools:** Building standalone desktop applications (`.exe`) with `CustomTkinter` to streamline and optimize the daily workflows and internal processes for myself and the IT team.
